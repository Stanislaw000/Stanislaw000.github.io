Hi!

I'm a software developer with over 10 years of programming experience devoted to creating great software that influences peopleâ€™s lives. I worked on vast variety of web projects ranging from small web API projects through large EpiServer CMS based solution for tens of thousands of simultaneous users to huge SaaS platform with thousands clients instances running at once.
I'm always focused on delivering high quality software designed to serve its purpose, so as a hobby I like to play with code quality tools like SonarQube.
